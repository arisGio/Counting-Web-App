// now that we have referenced html elements to variables
// we need to know if these elements underwent some EVENT
// eg if they have been clicked

// EVENTS are used to LISTEN to events that occur on a web page,
// such as when a user clicks a button,
// or scrolls down the page, among other things

    // Every time the add buttin is pressed, this code will execute.
    // Code in this scope (listener's callback) get's called
